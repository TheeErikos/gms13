<h1>Server Rules</h1>
<br>
<i>- Don't be a dick.
This is a rule that should need no explanation. Don't ruin another person's fun in-game just because you can, and don't be mean in OOC chat or other places.
<br>
-Act in-character, and play a character that is realistic and authentic.
Generally, avoid psychopaths and insane characters. Also keep in mind what would be a realistic thing for your character to do. A scientist with no weapons training is not going to be rushing armed boarders with a toolbox. Also, do not kill yourself without EXTREMELY good reason.
<br>
-Avoid antagonizing as non-antagonist
No bashing in heads, unless you're an antagonist role or it's self-defense. Try to avoid creating situations in which you're performing other massive crimes and generally acting as an antagonist would, again unless you're an antagonist or under extreme circumstances.
<br>
-No erotic roleplay
This should be self explanatory. Anything that you wouldn't be comfortable doing in a public park, don't do on the server.
<br>
-Follow Mode Specific Rules
Another rather self-explanatory rule. Just make sure you read these and follow them, because these are sometimes overlooked by players.
